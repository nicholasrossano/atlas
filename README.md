# Ponder Map

Ponder Map connects queer readers to queer literature through an AI assistant and an interactive map. The assistant helps folks discover books, authors, and stories that resonate, while the map makes it easy to explore titles by place, theme, and community context. You can check out the live map here: https://map.ponder-app.ai

## What it does

- **AI-guided discovery:** An assistant that helps readers find LGBTQ+ books and authors based on interests, identity, and vibe.
- **Map-first exploration:** Browse literature spatially to surface local voices, settings, and queer communities.
- **Community powered:** Anyone can suggest new books for inclusion.

## Roadmap ideas

Here are some of the things we want to build next:

- **Richer book detail pages** (additional metadata, themes, content notes, reviews, and reading levels).
- **Smarter assistant** (better recommendations, improved filtering, and more nuanced guidance).
- **More dynamic mapping** (filters, layers, and smarter geo-grouping).
- **Bigger library** (keep expanding the catalog of queer literature).
- **Broader categories** (potentially adding new top-level collections beyond LGBTQ literature).
